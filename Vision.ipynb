    "### Create a Face API Service\n",
    "To provision a Computer Vision API service in your Azure subscription, Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open another browser tab and navigate to https://portal.azure.com.\n",
    "2. Sign in using your Microsoft account.\n",
    "3. Click **+ Create a Resource**, and search **Face**.\n",
    "4. Click **Face** and in the **Create** blade, enter the following details, and then click **Review and Create** and then **Create**\n",
    "  * **Subscription**: Azure for Students or Microsoft Azure Sponsorship\n",
    "  * **Resource Group**: Choose the existing resource group you created earlier.\n",
    "  * **Region**: (US) South Central US\n",

    "Also, be sure to check the box verifying this service is not being used by or for a police department in the US.\n",
    "5. Wait for the service to be created.\n",
    "6. When deployment is complete, click **Go to Resource**.\n",
    "7. In your resource's blade, click **Keys and Endpoint** and then copy **Key 1** to the clipboard and paste it into the **faceKey** variable assignment value in the cell below.\n",
